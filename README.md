# Mandelbrot Set Visualiser

## A simple mandelbrot set visualiser made with sfml 2.5.1 64 bit

### How to use:

> input the x and y coordinates of the center point of the scene you want to render
> input the range of the camera (zoom level in a way) - it will render the mandelbrot set from point (x-range, y-range) to (x+range, y+range)
> input the resolution of the image to be rendered
> let it do it's thing

### To be done:
> switch the brute force computation from the CPU to the GPU (probably with CUDA)
> allow real time camera controls (zoom in/out, move around)
> generally optimise the program to run better
